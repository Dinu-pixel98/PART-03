INTRODUCTION

Online voting systems are software platforms used to securely conduct votes and elections. As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to cast the votes using paper or having to gather in person.

This system protects the integrity of the votes by preventing voters from being able to vote multiple times.

Many secure voting platform vendors provide supportive vote consulting services that help organizations design their voting procedures.

we created online voting system for the election commission of sri lanka. In this project we introduced a register form. First of all, the voters should register in register form. After that we send user name and password for registered voters. Users will be able to vote in election date through the web site(www.e-voating.lk). finally, we show count of votes each recognized political parties have got.












OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

1.	Coming up with an automated voting system in Sri Lanka.
2.	Develop a web-based voting system to be used in Election Commission or other departments.
3.	Validating the system to ensure that only legible voter is allowed to vote.
4.	Must be Database driven in order to keep track of voters.
5.	Administrator and user level access.
6.	Firmly understand web technology such as PHP and MySQL. 










THE CURRENT SITUATION OF ELECTION IN SRI LANKA

Sri Lanka elects on national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. Sri Lanka has a multi-party system, with two dominant political parties. All elections are administered by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka. 

Voting System

It is mandatory that the elector should carry one of any identity documents: National Identity Card (NIC)  or documents approved by the Election Commission such as the valid passport, valid driving license, senior citizens identity card, government pensioners’ identity card, identity card issued to clergy, temporary identity card issued by the Election Commission through Grama Niladhari. It is advisable to carry the official poll card which will be convenient to the elector as well as the poll staff. So, carry it as well.
01. The first officer examines the identity document National Identity Card (NIC), valid Passport, valid driving license, Identity card issued to clergy, government pensioners’ identity card or senior citizens’ identity card, temporary identity card issued by the Election Commission through Grama Niladhari) and tallies the persons face with the photograph in the identity document and if he is satisfied about identity, he directs the elector to the second officer.
02. Second officer asks for the official poll card carried by the elector, finds out his/ her name in the electoral register and asks the name of the elector and announces the name and the serial number of the elector loudly. If there is no objection, he directs the elector to the next officer.
03. Third officer examines the little finger of the left hand of the elector and applies indelible ink round the little finger. If the elector refuses applying indelible ink, he/she will not be able to cast vote. After applying ink, the next officer will issue a ballot paper to the voter.

Then the voter has to go to the covered cubicle with the ballot paper and mark the vote to the party or group of voter’s choices and mark the preferences to not more than the number of candidates required who are identified by the serial numbers given to them. The voter should properly fold the ballot paper into two or if necessary, into four and put it into the ballot box.


Disadvantages of current voting system

1.	Inconsistency in data entry, room for errors, mis keying information.
2.	Large ongoing staff training cost.
3.	System is dependent on good individuals.
4.	Reduction in sharing information and customer services.
5.	Time consuming and costly to produce reports.
6.	Lack of security.
7.	Duplication of data entry.
8.	Takes up a lot of space


As a solution we have proposed an online voting system for election of Sri Lanka.

ADVANTAGES OF ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM
•	Empowerment. Voting is the most powerful way for members to have a voice in the leadership and direction of their association. When allowed to vote in fair and open elections, members feel a greater sense of value, ownership, and responsibility. Online elections help empower members of associations, societies, and other democratic organizations by making voting easy and convenient.
•	Accessibility. Online voting allows association members to access their ballots from anywhere at any time, provided they have an Internet connection. This makes casting a vote convenient and fast. Members can cast their votes from home, from work or “on the go” via their mobile devices.
•	Cost effectiveness. Online voting reduces election budgets by limiting production costs. Paper, printing, and postage costs are all significantly lower for online elections than for traditional voting methods. In addition, staff will save time because online elections eliminate the need to assemble ballot packages and manually tabulate votes.
•	 Security and confidentiality. A properly designed, secure online voting system has safeguards in place to protect voting information and voter identities. A voting website hosted on a secure server will only be accessible to authorized members through unique voter logins. Online ballots are transmitted from voters’ computers or mobile devices to balloting systems using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), the same encryption technology used by U.S. financial institutions. These layers of protection form a technology shield that detects unauthorized access, eliminates ballot tampering, and reduces the chance of voting fraud.
•	Eco-friendly. Web-based balloting conserves resources by reducing the amount of paper associated with an election. Paper ballots, envelopes, flyers, and other paper collateral are either moved to electronic format or eliminated. This is particularly important if your association members are sensitive to the use of natural resources.
•	Membership engagement. Online voting and other modern participation methods demonstrate an association’s commitment to connecting with its members. It shows the organization is staying relevant and is dedicated to keeping in touch.
•	Appeal to younger members. According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 95 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 use the Internet. This means that online options such as web voting might be a great way to get younger members involved in the decision-making process.
•	Fast, accurate results. With online voting there are no rejected, mismarked or invalid ballots. Results are automatically calculated, eliminating the need for manual tabulation and dreaded recounts. Computerized tabulation allows election managers to quickly announce decisions and results.
•	Living in urban areas. This means that an association consisting primarily of older members who live in sparsely populated areas should consider maintaining some form of traditional voting practice. Before investing in an online voting system, take the time to break down your association’s demographics and tendencies so that you can build a voting process that best serves the needs of your members.
•	Expertise required. Building an online voting system requires programming experience and an understanding of election processes
